##I think youâ€™ve taken the wrong approach for the first question. You want to create an empty dictionary.
##Then loop through the parameter dictionary to get the keys in voteDict. If voteDict[key] is already in
##the new dictionary, you increase its value by 1. Otherwise you add it to the dictionary.
##
## 
##
##In the second problem, both the try and the except need to be inside the loop.
##You don't want any for loop in this problem.
##You can find out if a key is in a dictionary using "in" and y
##ou can access a value by using the key as an "index".
##
##You need to check if what the user enters is a key
##in the dictionary before trying to access the value.
##
##I don't know why you're creating a new dictionary.
##
##And please remove the else:pass. Can you see that is useless?
