##The search() function we did in class may be helpful here.
##Then you need to have a variable assigned at the top of the function. It will
##be used to count the number of subdirectories inside of path. If the number
##of subdirec
##tories in path is at least n, then you can return it at the end of
##the function.

##I also recommend that you have two variables. One variable will be a total
##
##that youâ€™re going to return in the end. The other will be a count of the 
##number of files inside the current directory. You need the second variable so
##that you can decide if you need to adjust the total variable before you
##return it


# directly or indirectly) and clearly state how you worked with them
# If you did not collaborate with anyone, say that
# Files without the above information will earn a 0

# Include doc strings for full credit

# The first three functions must be recursive and may not use global
# variables. You may not define any helper functions or modify the
# header of the functions in any way.
# The last function will not use recursion at all.

# You can change the import statement if you like

# Question 1
# This function must be recursive and should use a loop

# the top of the function, modified in the body of the function,
# and involved in the return statement ONLY at the END
